<p align="center"> A terminal interface for the CaulfieldLife timetable </p>

The main purpose of this utility was to get past the frequent breakages of the CaulfieldLife website.

### Timetable
The `tt` file is a script that gets the subjects of the specified day from your local cache.

The `ttsync` file is a script that fetches your timetable from CaulfieldLife via https://caulfieldsync-docs.vercel.app/developers/timetable and outputs it to your local cache, and is run asynchronously.
