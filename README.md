<p align="center"> A fast terminal interface to the CaulfieldLife timetable</p>

The main purpose of this utility was to get past the frequent breakages of the CaulfieldLife website.

## Intro
The main function of `ttbl` (timetable) is to get the day's subjects instantly from your local cache. The two secondary functions are to fetch your api token from [here](https://caulfieldsync-docs.vercel.app/developers/token), and to sync the database of subjects onto your local cache (this can be configured to run asynchronously).
